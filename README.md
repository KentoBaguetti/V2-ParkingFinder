# The Future of Parking - Future Park

Our project **"Future Park"** is aimed at addressing the inefficiencies of parking in congested urban areas like Vancouver. Our solution offers a centralized, real-time parking app that integrates government-supported infrastructure and Google Maps to improve accessibility, reduce congestion, and support sustainable practices.

## Problem

Efficient parking is crucial to mitigate the underlying social, economic, and environmental challenges in cities like Vancouver. Current parking inefficiencies contribute to:

- **Time Loss:** Drivers spend an average of 17+ hours/year searching for parking.
- **Traffic Congestion:** 30% of urban traffic is attributed to parking searches.
- **Accidents:** 31% of all crashes occur in parking lots.
- **Environmental Impact:** Idling vehicles produce 30 million tons of CO2 annually.

### Local Concerns
- Over 300,000 parking tickets are issued annually in downtown Vancouver.
- Translink, Vancouver's transit authority, faces a $200 million annual funding gap, with a projected $4.7 billion debt by 2036.

2. **Government Support:** Leverages street cameras, sensors, and integrates the pay-by-phone system.
3. **Google Maps Integration:** Enhances navigation to optimize parking spot searches.

### Features
- **Real-Time Data:** Access live parking availability and integrated payment options.
- **Congestion Reduction:** Helps reduce idling and traffic by guiding drivers efficiently.
- **Sustainability Focus:** Aligns with Vancouver's Net 0 by 2050 goal.
- **Government and Private Collaboration:** Combines street-side parking with private lot data for a seamless experience.
